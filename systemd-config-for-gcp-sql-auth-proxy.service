[Service]
# Replace with the user you want to run the proxy as.
# It's good practice not to use root if not strictly necessary.
# You might need to create a dedicated user or use an existing non-root user.
# If the proxy needs to write logs or pid files to specific locations,
# ensure this user has permissions. For simplicity, you can start with your own user
# or root, but consider a dedicated service account for better security.
User=root # Or your non-root user e.g., your-username
# Alternatively, create a dedicated service user:
# sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false cloudsqlproxyuser
# User=cloudsqlproxyuser

# The command to start the proxy.
# Adjust --port if you need a different one.
# Add --credentials-file=/path/to/your/service-account-key.json if you are using a JSON key
# instead of the VM's default service account. Using the VM's service account is often simpler.
